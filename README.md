## Description

This project is an example of using [nng](https://github.com/nanomsg/nng) in the app based
on [BearLibTerminal](http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal).

In fact, this app is a console-like client-server chat.\
It makes heavy use of things like multithreading and synchronization.

Unfortunately, there are nng binaries only for 64-bit Linux at the moment.\
If you're going to use this demo on another OS, you should build them by yourself using instructions from the official
repository.\
However, `./CMake/Findnng.cmake` is almost ready to the moment of adding binaries for following operating systems:

* 32-bit Linux
* 32-bit Windows
* 64-bit Windows
* OS X

Binaries should be added in the same way as BearLibTerminal binaries (see `./CMake/FindBearLibTerminal.cmake` and
`./lib/BearLibTerminal`).

## Tech stack

* C++20
* nng
* nngpp (modern C++ wrapper for nng)
* BearLibTerminal

## How to build

### Linux

1. Install CMake, GNU Make, gcc, g++
2. Run `make clean reload build`

### Windows

1. Install MSYS2
2. Run `pacman -Syu` in the MinGW console
3. Re-open the MinGW console
4. Run following commands in the MinGW console:
    ```
    pacman -Su
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-make mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb
    ```
5. Add paths to directories with tools installed in the previous step to your system's `PATH` environment variable
6. Run `mingw32-make.exe clean reload build`

## How to run

### Linux

Run the following command:

```
# server
make exec_server REQ_REP_ENDPOINT=tcp://127.0.0.1:5555 PUB_SUB_ENDPOINT=tcp://127.0.0.1:5556

# client
make exec_client REQ_REP_ENDPOINT=tcp://127.0.0.1:5555 PUB_SUB_ENDPOINT=tcp://127.0.0.1:5556
```

### Windows

Run the following command:

```
# server
mingw32-make.exe exec_server REQ_REP_ENDPOINT=tcp://127.0.0.1:5555 PUB_SUB_ENDPOINT=tcp://127.0.0.1:5556

# client
mingw32-make.exe exec_client REQ_REP_ENDPOINT=tcp://127.0.0.1:5555 PUB_SUB_ENDPOINT=tcp://127.0.0.1:5556
```
